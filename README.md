# Machine Learning Models Repository  

Welcome to my Machine Learning Models repository! 🚀  

## 📌 About  
In this repository, you will find various machine learning models that I have created over time. Each model is implemented using Python and relevant machine learning library **Scikit-Learnh**.  

## 📂 Repository Structure  
- **`classification/`** - Contains models for classification tasks.  
- **`regression/`** - Includes models for regression problems.  
- **`notebooks/`** - Jupyter integrated notebooks with code explanations and results.  

## ⚡ Features  
✅ Different ML algorithms implemented from scratch and using popular libraries.  
✅ Well-documented code with explanations.  
✅ Jupyter Notebooks for interactive learning and experimentation.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- Python 🐍  
- Scikit-Learn   
- Pandas & NumPy  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
